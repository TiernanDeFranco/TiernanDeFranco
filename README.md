**Software Developer**

I'm a self taught software developer who loves building projects and learning the ropes as I go.
I love creating things and if I wasn't a programmer I'd be making board games, designing clothes, learning physics and chemistry and the intricacies of the universe.
Unfortunatley there's only so much you can do in one lifetime, so I decided to dedicate my time to coding. (Which I think was a great choice)

  <summary><h3>üë®‚ÄçüíªTiernan's Coding Journey</summary>
   I originally started my coding journey at age 9 with GameMaker 7 and drag-and-drop programming. It was so fun creating little games and I knew even if it wasn't specifically game dev, I wanted to do something in this field.
   <br />
<br />
   Fast forward to highscool and I use GameMaker Studio 2 and GML (GameMaker Language) to develop some fun little projects, including my chemistry final project which my teacher was amazed by.
   In my senior year of highschool, I took a Computer Science Principles class where we used MIT App Inventor, VexCode, and Python (in VSCode).
   It was at this point I knew I was going to make this a career and upon graduation in May I began researching and learning languages. I started with Python trying to piggyback off of what I had learned in the class but I realized I didn't know the practical use application.
   After months of learning I suddenly had the urge to make a mobile app. Why? Because MyFitnessPal started charging their premium subscription to use the barcode scanner and view macro goals, so like any reasonable person I sought to develop my own free alternative instead of just downloading a different app.
   That led me down the .NET MAUI and C# path, which got me into doing frontend in MAUI and my backend api in ASP.NET Core, and my database in MS SQL Server. I have since migrated my progress from .NET MAUI to Uno Platform as it allows more flexibility for what I want to do with the app.

   <br />
    <br />
   Upon completion of my app (HealthMode), I will go into the world of freelancing, building up my skills, portfolio, and experience and hopefully find some jobs out on the west coast as it is a dream of mine to move to Las Vegas!
