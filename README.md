**Software Developer**

I'm a self taught software developer who loves building projects and learning the ropes as I go.
I love creating things and if I wasn't a programmer I'd be making board games, designing clothes, learning physics and chemistry and the intricacies of the universe.
Unfortunately there's only so much you can do in one lifetime, so I decided to dedicate my time to coding. (Which I think was a great choice)
